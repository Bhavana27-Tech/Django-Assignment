Q1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? Please support your answer with a code snippet that conclusively proves your stance. The code does not need to be elegant and production ready, we just need to understand your logic.
Ans: By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. Which means that the signal handler function is called directly within the same thread as  the event that triggered the signal.
