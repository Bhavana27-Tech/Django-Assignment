Q1: By default are django signals executed synchronously or asynchronously? 

Ans: By default, Django signals are executed synchronously. Which means that the signal handler function is called directly within the same thread as  the event that triggered the signal.


Code Snippet 
------------

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

from .models import MyModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender,   
 instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler is being executed synchronously.")
    # Perform long-running tasks here
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running task

Q2. Do django signals run in the same thread as the caller?

Ans:Yes, Django signals are executed in the same thread as the caller. Which means that signal handler function is called directly within the same thread as the event triggered the signal.

Code Snippet 
------------

from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

from .models import MyModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender,   
 instance, **kwargs):
    print("Signal handler is being executed synchronously.")
    # Perform long-running tasks here
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulate a long-running task


Q3.By default do django signals run in the same database transaction as the caller? 

Ans:Django signals do not run in the same database transaction as the caller by default. This means that any changes made within a signal handler will be committed in a separate transaction, independent of the transaction that triggered the signal.

Code Snippet 
------------
from django.db import transaction
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from .models import MyModel, RelatedModel

@receiver(post_save, sender=MyModel)
def my_signal_handler(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    with transaction.atomic():
        related_object = RelatedModel.objects.create(my_model=instance)
        if created:
            # Raise an exception to simulate a rollback
            raise Exception("Error during signal handling")

# Trigger the signal
my_model_instance = MyModel.objects.create(field1="value1")
